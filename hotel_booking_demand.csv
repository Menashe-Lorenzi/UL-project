We used the publicly available Hotel Booking Demand dataset from Kaggle, containing 119,390
bookings and 32 features spanning 2015–2017. From the full dataset, we randomly sampled 20,000
records to reduce computational load, while recognizing that this sample size is sufficiently large to
yield robust insights.
